# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice Repository** â€” a collection of notebooks, experiments, and mini-projects that cover core ML concepts, algorithms, and applications.  
This repo is meant to track my learning progress, test new ideas, and build strong foundations in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.

---

##  Overview

This repository includes:
- Implementations of **classical ML algorithms** from scratch and using **Scikit-learn**.
- Practice notebooks for **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **ensemble** learning.
- Projects on **real-world datasets** for better understanding and visualization.
- Comparisons of models, feature engineering, and evaluation techniques.
